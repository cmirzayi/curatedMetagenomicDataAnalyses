# Curated Metagenomic Analyses

This repository provides biologically relevant analyses using the [curatedMetagenomicData](https://bioconductor.org/packages/curatedMetagenomicData/) package, both using R/Bioconductor and using Python. You can run both R and Python analyses locally in the provided Docker container, or on the Cloud for free.

## Running on the Cloud for free

A machine with all dependencies, code from this repository, and Jupyterlab (with R and Python3) and RStudio running is available at http://app.orchestra.cancerdatasci.org/ (search for the Curated Metagenomic Analyses workshop). You can use these machines for up to 8 hours at a time.

## Running locally using Docker
